# Project 3: Turing Machine simulator

* Author: Ted Moore Ben Brindley
* Class: CS361 Section 002
* Semester: Spring 2023

## Overview

This program creates a turing machine class that can be simulated 
given an input file as described by the project description.

## Reflection

Knowing that the efficiency of the program was being tested before starting
working on this project made it easier to make. Trying to change things later
to mae it run faster would have proven difficult. By having the idea of efficiency
in my mind from the start made it easier by the end. The concepts of the project
are clear. I do wish I could get to see what the 'most efficient' code would be for 
this. Breaking up each part of our code into methods made it very easy to debug. 

If I could change anything I would have wanted to look into multithreadin in java.
I didn't get the chance but I also don't think it would have proved useful. But 
this uncertainty made me want to look into it.

## Compiling and Using

This section should tell the user how to compile your code.  It is
also appropriate to instruct the user how to use your code. Does your
program require user input? If so, what does your user need to know
about it to use it as quickly as possible?

User can compile this code with the following:
  javac TMSimulator.java

And run the code with the following:
  java TMSimulator [file]
